  conclusion:[
    "While designing for an update, the designer should know how to improve the product by changing so little on the current product. Balance the new design and the old systems. Any changes made on the existed product may cause chaos in the database. Both engineers and designers should do their best to avoid this issue.",
    "There is no perfect solution. It's all about teamwork and cooperation. It is crucial to understand the capacity of your team. We can not design something that can not happen. There are no unlimited resources either. Recognizing the limitation of your team will help you make appropriate design decisions.",
    "Know acknowledge to the origin of the data showed. "
